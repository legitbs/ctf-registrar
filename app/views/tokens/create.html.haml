  %h2 Successfully Enabled
  :markdown
    You've enabled two-factor authentication for your account. Print out this
    page and keep it somewhere safe. You'll need the QR code to put your secret
    on a new phone if your current one is lost, stolen, or destroyed in a
    beverage spill. The fallback codes can be used one time each in case you
    don't have your phone temporarily.
