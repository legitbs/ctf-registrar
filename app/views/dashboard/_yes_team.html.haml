        Give your teammates the name (it's "#{h team.name}" without quotes)
        and the team password you entered when you created the team. Don't
        give them your personal account password.

        Until the game starts, that's about all you can do. Thanks and
        good luck!

        Anyone on your team can pick questions. Hope they pick good ones!

        Team members will be able to read, answer, and pick questions.

      :markdown
        You're a member of #{h team.name}.

        When the game starts, you'll be able to read, answer, and pick
        questions.

        Until the game starts, practice, stock up on caffeinated beverages,
        and get ready to compete! Good luck!
