    We're hosting CTF chat in #defconctf on the "Hackint" 
    network. See [http://www.hackint.org/](http://www.hackint.org/) for connection 
    information. Any judgements or 
    changes will also be broadcast on our Twitter account at 
    [https://twitter.com/legitbs_ctf](https://twitter.com/legitbs_ctf), and displayed 
    on the scoreboard as well.

    The game will start with several questions unlocked. When a question is
    answered for the first time, it'll unlock the next question in its category.
    If it was the last in its category, it doesn't unlock anything.

    All answers will be preceded by “The flag is: “. If you see “The flag is: asdf 12345” 
    submit “asdf 12345” without the quotation marks. Keys are case sensitive.

    **DO NOT SUBMIT "The flag is: " AS PART OF YOUR ANSWER.**

    There is no point penalty for wrong answers. However, excessive wrong guesses will
    be penalized with per-question or per-team timeouts. Since all answers will be 
    clearly marked, we trust this won’t be a problem.

    Don’t share answers.

    All challenges will be hosted at \*.shallweplayaga.me . Do not attack machines 
    outside of this subdomain.

    The scoreboard is at https://2014.legitbs.net; you're in the right place.

    Do not attack machines inside of legitbs.net.

    All judges’ decisions during the game are final.
